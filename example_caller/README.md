# Benchmarking Setup

This project can be used to benchmark requests. Before you begin testing, you must ensure that three Internet Computer (IC) canisters and a notary server are up and running.

## Notary Server

- **Default URL:**  
  Your local verity notary will be used by default at `http://localhost:8080`.  
- **Custom URL:**  
  Change this by setting the environment variable:  
  ```bash
  export NOTARY_URL="https://your-notary-url"
  ```

## Required Canisters

The following canisters must be deployed in order:

1. **Managed Verifier**  
   Repository: [Managed Verifier](https://github.com/usherlabs/verity-dp/tree/main/ic/managed/verifier)  
   *Note:* The canister ID for the Managed Verifier will be required in the next step.

2. **ADC Processor**  
   Location: [ADC Processor](../processor/ic)  
   To configure this canister, set the verifier address by calling  the `set_verifier_canister` method

3. **ADC Caller Example**  
   Run the ADC_Caller example and set the ADC address using the `set_adc_address` method.

## Running the Benchmark

Once all three canisters are running, you can edit the benchmark URL (located in `./__tests__/test_adc.test.ts`) if needed. Then, prepare and run your tests using either npm or yarn:

```bash
# Using npm:
npm run prep
npm run test

# Or using yarn:
yarn prep
yarn test
```

# processor_caller Project

Welcome to your new `processor_caller` project and the Internet Computer development community! When you create a project, this README and a set of template files are added automatically to help speed up your development cycle. Feel free to customize these files to suit your needs.

## Getting Started

Take a moment to explore the project directory and review the default configuration file. Changes made locally will not affect any production deployment or identity tokens.

For more detailed guidance, consult the following resources:

- [Quick Start](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/deploy-locally)
- [SDK Developer Tools](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/install)
- [Rust Canister Development Guide](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/backend/rust/)
- [ic-cdk Documentation](https://docs.rs/ic-cdk)
- [ic-cdk-macros Documentation](https://docs.rs/ic-cdk-macros)
- [Candid Introduction](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/backend/candid/)

If you're ready to begin, try running the following commands:

```bash
cd processor_caller/
dfx help
dfx canister --help
```

## Running the Project Locally

To test your project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Start the Local Replica:**

   ```bash
   dfx start --background
   ```

2. **Deploy the Canisters:**

   ```bash
   dfx deploy
   ```

   After deployment, your application will be available at:
   ```
   http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}
   ```

3. **Regenerate the Candid Interface:**

   If you update your backend canister, run:
   ```bash
   npm run generate
   ```
   This step is recommended before starting the frontend development server and is also executed automatically during `dfx deploy`.

4. **Start the Frontend Development Server:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   This command starts a server at `http://localhost:8080` that proxies API requests to the replica on port 4943.

## Frontend Environment Variables

If you are hosting the frontend code without using DFX, consider the following adjustments to prevent your project from fetching the root key in production:

- **For Webpack Users:**  
  Set `DFX_NETWORK` to `ic`.

- **Replacing Environment Variables:**  
  Use your preferred method to replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` in the autogenerated declarations. For example, in `dfx.json` you can set:
  ```json
  "canisters": {
    "asset_canister_id": {
      "declarations": {
        "env_override": "your_value"
      }
    }
  }
  ```

- **Custom Actor Creation:**  
  Alternatively, implement your own `createActor` constructor.
